# OGX-Mini Proto

A fork of [OGX Mini](https://github.com/wiredopposite/OGX-Mini) to prototype additional features. See the [OGX Mini readme]([https://github.com/wiredopposite/OGX-Mini]) for more information about the project and what it is for.

Additions so far:
 - Proof of concept support for an OLED screen to display adapter status. All it does for now is display a short string.
